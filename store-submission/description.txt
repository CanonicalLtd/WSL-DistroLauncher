Ubuntu on Windows allows one to use Ubuntu Terminal and run Ubuntu command line utilities including bash, ssh, git, apt and many more.

Note that Windows 10 S does not support running this app.

Before installing Ubuntu on Windows or before the first run please open the Control Panel, visit Programs and Features' submenu Turn Windows features on or off and select Windows Subsystem for Linux. Click OK, reboot, and then your system is ready to run this app.

Instead of the above steps You can set up your system by executing the following command in the Administrator PowerShell prompt:
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux

When your system is ready simply start "ubuntu" in cmd.exe or launch Ubuntu from the start menu.

This app installs the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS release on Windows.

Please note that app updates don't change the Ubuntu installation. To upgrade to a new release please run do-release-upgrade in the Ubuntu Terminal.
